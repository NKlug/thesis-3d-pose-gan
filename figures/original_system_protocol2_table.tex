		Comparison of the MPJPEs of the replicated system trained and tested with synthetic data and 2D poses from the Human3.6M dataset \cite{ionescu14}. 
		For \cite{drover18} only results with rigid alignment are available, which allows no fair comparison.
		The results were obtained using \textbf{Protocol 2}. The MPJPEs are given in millimeters.
