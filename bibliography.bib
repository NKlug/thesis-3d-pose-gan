The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

	abstract = {3D pose estimation from a single image is a challenging task in computer vision. We present a weakly supervised approach to estimate 3D pose points, given only 2D pose landmarks. Our method does not require correspondences between 2D and 3D points to build explicit 3D priors. We utilize an adversarial framework to impose a prior on the 3D structure, learned solely from their random 2D projections. Given a set of 2D pose landmarks, the generator network hypothesizes their depths to obtain a 3D skeleton. We propose a novel Random Projection layer, which randomly projects the generated 3D skeleton and sends the resulting 2D pose to the discriminator. The discriminator improves by discriminating between the generated poses and pose samples from a real distribution of 2D poses. Training does not require correspondence between the 2D inputs to either the generator or the discriminator. We apply our approach to the task of 3D human pose estimation. Results on Human3.6M dataset demonstrates that our approach outperforms many previous supervised and weakly supervised approaches.},

	abstract = {  Following the success of deep convolutional networks, state-of-the-art
methods for 3d human pose estimation have focused on deep end-to-end systems
that predict 3d joint locations given raw image pixels. Despite their excellent
performance, it is often not easy to understand whether their remaining error
stems from a limited 2d pose (visual) understanding, or from a failure to map
2d poses into 3-dimensional positions. With the goal of understanding these
sources of error, we set out to build a system that given 2d joint locations
predicts 3d positions. Much to our surprise, we have found that, with current
technology, "lifting" ground truth 2d joint locations to 3d space is a task
that can be solved with a remarkably low error rate: a relatively simple deep
feed-forward network outperforms the best reported result by about 30\% on
Human3.6M, the largest publicly available 3d pose estimation benchmark.
Furthermore, training our system on the output of an off-the-shelf
state-of-the-art 2d detector (\ie, using images as input) yields state of the
art results -- this includes an array of systems that have been trained
end-to-end specifically for this task. Our results indicate that a large
portion of the error of modern deep 3d pose estimation systems stems from their
visual analysis, and suggests directions to further advance the state of the
art in 3d human pose estimation.

	abstract = {  Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the
distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters
of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower
learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously
hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this
phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing
layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of
the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training
mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and
be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some
cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image
classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14
times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant
margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the
best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5
validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.

	abstract = {  This paper addresses the problem of 3D human pose estimation from a single
image. We follow a standard two-step pipeline by first detecting the 2D
position of the $N$ body joints, and then using these observations to infer 3D
pose. For the first step, we use a recent CNN-based detector. For the second
step, most existing approaches perform 2$N$-to-3$N$ regression of the Cartesian
joint coordinates. We show that more precise pose estimates can be obtained by
representing both the 2D and 3D human poses using $N\times N$ distance
matrices, and formulating the problem as a 2D-to-3D distance matrix regression.
For learning such a regressor we leverage on simple Neural Network
architectures, which by construction, enforce positivity and symmetry of the
predicted matrices. The approach has also the advantage to naturally handle
missing observations and allowing to hypothesize the position of non-observed
joints. Quantitative results on Humaneva and Human3.6M datasets demonstrate
consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art. Qualitative evaluation on
the images in-the-wild of the LSP dataset, using the regressor learned on
Human3.6M, reveals very promising generalization results.

available, making it tempting to lift predicted 2D poses to 3D through simple

to implement with off-the-shelf 2D pose estimation systems and 3D mocap

significant challenge is the lack of training data, i.e., 2D images of humans
annotated with 3D poses. Such data is necessary to train state-of-the-art CNN
architectures. Here, we propose a solution to generate a large set of
photorealistic synthetic images of humans with 3D pose annotations. We
introduce an image-based synthesis engine that artificially augments a dataset
of real images with 2D human pose annotations using 3D Motion Capture (MoCap)
data. Given a candidate 3D pose our algorithm selects for each joint an image
whose 2D pose locally matches the projected 3D pose. The selected images are
then combined to generate a new synthetic image by stitching local image
patches in a kinematically constrained manner. The resulting images are used to
train an end-to-end CNN for full-body 3D pose estimation. We cluster the
training data into a large number of pose classes and tackle pose estimation as
a K-way classification problem. Such an approach is viable only with large
training sets such as ours. Our method outperforms the state of the art in
terms of 3D pose estimation in controlled environments (Human3.6M) and shows
promising results for in-the-wild images (LSP). This demonstrates that CNNs
trained on artificial images generalize well to real images.

hypotheses in 3D all consistent with the 2D detection of joints in a monocular

anatomically plausible 3D poses. Our model is compositional (produces a pose by
combining parts) and since it is restricted only by anatomical constraints it
can generalize to every plausible human 3D pose. Removing the model bias
intrinsically helps to generate more diverse 3D pose hypotheses. We argue that
generating multiple pose hypotheses is more reasonable than generating only a
single 3D pose based on the 2D joint detection given the depth ambiguity and
the uncertainty due to occlusion and imperfect 2D joint detection. We hope that
the idea of generating multiple consistent pose hypotheses can give rise to a
new line of future work that has not received much attention in the literature.

	abstract = {  Researchers have developed excellent feed-forward models that learn to map
images to desired outputs, such as to the images' latent factors, or to other
images, using supervised learning. Learning such mappings from unlabelled data,
or improving upon supervised models by exploiting unlabelled data, remains
elusive. We argue that there are two important parts to learning without
annotations: (i) matching the predictions to the input observations, and (ii)
matching the predictions to known priors. We propose Adversarial Inverse
Graphics networks (AIGNs): weakly supervised neural network models that combine
feedback from rendering their predictions, with distribution matching between
their predictions and a collection of ground-truth factors. We apply AIGNs to
3D human pose estimation and 3D structure and egomotion estimation, and
outperform models supervised by only paired annotations. We further apply AIGNs
to facial image transformation using super-resolution and inpainting renderers,
while deliberately adding biases in the ground-truth datasets. Our model
seamlessly incorporates such biases, rendering input faces towards young, old,
feminine, masculine or Tom Cruise-like equivalents (depending on the chosen
bias), or adding lip and nose augmentations while inpainting concealed lips and
noses.

@inproceedings{kingma17,
	abstract = {  We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization
of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order
moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally
efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling
of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of
data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary
objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The
hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little
tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are
discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the
algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable
to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework.
Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares
favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax,
a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.

with a task that is easily manageable for humans: perceiving 3D pose of a human

Methods The Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE, ScieLo and PubMed databases were used, for the period 2011--2015. Results 131 articles were found based on keyword of which 15 articles met the established eligibility criteria. Of these, 4 were based on photogrammetry, and 11 based on laser, structured light, ultrasound, and Moir{\'e} projection. In these studies, the methodological quality varied from low to high. Conclusions The findings indicated diversity in methodologies; 14/15 articles reviewed were limited to the evaluation of the topography of the posterior back. A study, using two-dimensional photogrammetry, presented a whole body postural evaluation. As the asymmetry in AIS can be extended to the whole body, more attention should be given to develop full body assessment techniques to provide important additional data to aid in treatment decisions.},

	abstract = {A neurological illness is t he disorder in human nervous system that can result in various diseases including the motor disabilities. Neurological disorders may affect the motor neurons, which are associated with skeletal muscles and control the body movement. Consequently, they introduce some diseases in the human e.g. cerebral palsy, spinal scoliosis, peripheral paralysis of arms/legs, hip joint dysplasia and various myopathies. Vojta therapy is considered a useful technique to treat the motor disabilities. In Vojta therapy, a specific stimulation is given to the patient's body to perform certain reflexive pattern movements which the patient is unable to perform in a normal manner. The repetition of stimulation ultimately brings forth the previously blocked connections between the spinal cord and the brain. After few therapy sessions, the patient can perform these movements without external stimulation. In this paper, we propose a computer vision-based system to monitor the correct movements of the patient during the therapy treatment using the RGBD data. The proposed framework works in three steps. In the first step, patient's body is automatically detected and segmented and two novel techniques are proposed for this purpose. In the second step, a multi-dimensional feature vector is computed to define various movements of patient's body during the therapy. In the final step, a multi-class support vector machine is used to classify these movements. The experimental evaluation carried out on the large captured dataset shows that the proposed system is highly useful in monitoring the patient's body movements during Vojta therapy.},

machines to have an understanding of people in images and videos. In this work,
we present a realtime approach to detect the 2D pose of multiple people in an

to as Part Affinity Fields (PAFs), to learn to associate body parts with
individuals in the image. This bottom-up system achieves high accuracy and
realtime performance, regardless of the number of people in the image. In
previous work, PAFs and body part location estimation were refined
simultaneously across training stages. We demonstrate that a PAF-only
refinement rather than both PAF and body part location refinement results in a
substantial increase in both runtime performance and accuracy. We also present
the first combined body and foot keypoint detector, based on an internal
annotated foot dataset that we have publicly released. We show that the
combined detector not only reduces the inference time compared to running them
sequentially, but also maintains the accuracy of each component individually.
This work has culminated in the release of OpenPose, the first open-source

We therefore apply the concept of CNNs in order to automatically infer the required pose information. Starting with an off-the-shelf architecture, we develop extensions to leverage activity information - in our case the swimming style of an athlete - and the continuous nature of the video recordings. Our main contributions are threefold: (a) We apply and evaluate a fine-tuned Convolutional Pose Machine architecture as a baseline in our very challenging aquatic environment and discuss its error modes, (b) we propose an extension to input swimming style information into the fully convolutional architecture and (c) modify the architecture for continuous pose estimation in videos. With these additions we achieve reliable pose estimates with up to +16\% more correct body joint detections compared to the baseline architecture.},

dependencies between variables in structured prediction tasks such as
articulated pose estimation. We achieve this by designing a sequential
architecture composed of convolutional networks that directly operate on belief
maps from previous stages, producing increasingly refined estimates for part
