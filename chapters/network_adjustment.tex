\section{Part 2: Adjusting the network to tolerate shifting}
\label{sec:network-adjusting}

Error on original poses when training on "shift generator": 73.75
\subsection{Original network with correct reprojection}
These are the results of the original network with a correct re-projection of the estimated poses into three dimensional space.


\subsection{"New" network}
Network that takes a shifted input and also correctly re-projects the estimated poses.
