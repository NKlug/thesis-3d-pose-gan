\section{Prevention of the Effects of Pose Normalization}
\label{sec:network-adjusting}

The results of the previous section show that the network proposed by \citet{drover18} is not viable for practical use as is.
Especially if the camera photographing the poses was not centered at the root joint, a significant increase in MPJPE is measurable.
This motivates further looking into how this increased error can be circumvented.
This section will focus on the error introduced by shifting along the image plane, to be precise on shifting along the x axis, as it shows more significant additional MPJPE than shifting along the z axis.

In Equation \eqref{eq:re-projected-X}, if the point would be re-projected correctly (i.e. shifted back before re-projection), the theoretical lower bound would no longer hold true.
In that case, if the generator estimates all depths perfectly the re-projected pose equals the ground truth pose up to a shift.
Thus, in a first attempt to efface the error, the re-projection of the poses into three dimensional space will be adapted.

\subsection{Correct Re-Projection}

For a correct re-projection of the 2D poses into three dimensions, the network presented earlier is slightly modified.
The network now receives poses that are only normalized in scale, but not in location.
In a first step, the vector $(dx, dy)^\mathrm{T}$ given by the root joint's coordinates is subtracted from all 2D points, such that the 2D poses are now normalized both in scaled and in location.
Afterwards, the depth offsets $o_i$ are estimated for each point in the same way as in the original network.
Before the pose is then re-projected into three dimensions, the points are shifted back by adding $(dx, dy)^\mathrm{T}$ to each point again.

\input{figures/x_shift_correct_reprojection}

For the evaluation of this modified network, a pre-trained version of the original network in combination with the correct re-projection is utilized.
Protocol 2 MPJPEs are calculated for different offsets $dx$, while $dy = 0$.
The results for this procedure are shown in Figure \ref{fig:x-shift-error-correct-reproj}.

Comparison to modified network trained from scratch.
The 3D poses are normalized before the Random Projection Layer in order to avoid having to sample offsets.
The discriminator still only receives the normalized 2D input poses.


\subsection{Modified Network}
The correct re-projection of the 2D points into three dimensions without further adaption of the network was already able to reduce the MPJPE for shifted poses.
In an attempt to achieve the same MPJPE for all offsets $dx$, the network receives an additional piece of information.
On top of the correct re-projection, the vector $(dx, dy)^\mathrm{T}$ is now passed to the network alongside the 2D input pose.
In theory this should eliminate any ambiguities existing because of the normalization.

The network's input is now a vector of size $32$. 
The first $30$ elements are the coordinates of the normalized input pose's 15 joints, and the last two elements are the offsets $dx$ and $dy$.
During training the generator receives poses which have an offset $dx$ between $-10$m and $10$m.
As before, in order to avoid sampling offsets for the Random Projection Layer, the discriminator receives only such 2D poses which have an offset of $dx = 0$, while $dy = 0$.
