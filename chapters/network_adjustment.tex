\section{Part 2: Adjusting the network to tolerate shifting}
\label{sec:network-adjusting}

The results of Section \ref{sec:z-shift-error} show that the model proposed by \citet{drover18} is not really viable for practical use.
Error on original poses when training on "shift generator": 73.75
\subsection{Original network with correct re-projection}
These are the results of the original network with a correct re-projection of the estimated poses into three dimensional space.


\subsection{"New" network}
\Todo[inline]{Figure of new network}
Network that takes a shifted input and also correctly re-projects the estimated poses.
Experimental results: Very low error for shifted points
