\section{Network architecture}
\begin{itemize}
	\item basic principle of gans???
	\item Basic architecture used in the paper
	\item Mention batch norm not working?
	\item Projection and reprojection.
\end{itemize}

Assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item All 2d data can be scaled in a way that a norm limb is of length 0.1. 
	Problems with correct camera distance, see section \ref{sec:z-shift-error}
	\item All data was captured with the same camera distance.
\end{itemize}
