\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

For training and evaluation of the models the dataset Human3.6M is used \cite{ionescu14}. 
It contains 3.6 million three dimensional human poses captured by digital and motion capture cameras, consisting of data from 11 subjects (6 male, 5 female) performing 15 different activities such as walking, taking a photo, eating or smoking.
The poses are available in different parametrizations, but only the one with 3D joint positions transformed with the camera parameters of the 4 digital cameras were used for training and evaluation (called \texttt{D3\_Positions\_mono} in the dataset).

32 joints and 15 / 17 joints

In the literature multiple different evaluation methods are used. 
This is partly because not all models produce absolute 3D poses, but some only up to a scaling factor or alignment of joints.
Therefore, some modifications have to be made in order to measure the quality and allow a fair comparison to other approaches.
Essentially two different evaluation protocols with minor variations have emerged which will be presented and discussed in the following.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
The most commonly used metric for evaluation is the Mean per Joint Position Error (MPJPE).
For $n$ joints, original 3D joint positions $O_i$ and predicted positions $P_i$ it is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}  \norm{O_i - P_i}_2 \ .
\end{equation}

\subsection{Protocol 1}

This protocol is used under different names in slightly different variations in \cite{sun17, drover18, moreno-noguer16, yasin16, kostrikov14, tome17}.
The method commonly referred to as \textbf{Protocol 1} uses subjects S1, S5, S6, S7, S8 and S9 for training and S11 for testing.

Sometimes the train data is thinned out further by the elimination of similar poses \cite{yasin16}.
\citet{drover18} even completely leave out S8 for training.
It allows rigid alignment \cite{drover18, yasin16, kostrikov14, sun17, tome17, chen17} of the predicted poses to the ground truth data.


Most authors do not explicitly state which kind of rigid alignment is applied to the predicted poses.
Those who do mention a Procrustes Analysis \cite{sun17, tome17} or a Least Squares transformation \cite{kostrikov14}. 

In accordance with the code shipped with the Human3.6M dataset, \citet{sun17}, \citet{chen17} and \citet{moreno-noguer16} use only every \nth{64} frame of the available data for testing.

\subsection{Different errors for different sets of joints}
	Using only 15 joints yields a much lower MPJPE than using 32 joints. Reasons: ...	
	From now on all numbers are calculated for 15 joint poses.
