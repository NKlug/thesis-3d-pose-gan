\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

For training and evaluation of the models the dataset Human3.6M is used \cite{ionescu14}. 
It contains 3.6 million three dimensional human poses captured by digital and motion capture cameras, consisting of data from 11 subjects (6 male, 5 female) performing 15 different activities such as walking, taking a photo, eating or smoking.
The poses are available in different parametrizations, but only the one with 3D joint positions transformed with the camera parameters of the 4 digital cameras were used for training and evaluation (called \texttt{D3\_Positions\_mono} in the dataset).

32 joints and 15 / 17 joints

In the literature multiple different evaluation methods are used. 
This is partly because not all models produce absolute 3D poses, but some only up to a scaling factor or alignment of joints.
Therefore, some modifications have to be made in order to measure the quality and allow a fair comparison to other approaches.
Essentially two different evaluation protocols with minor variations have emerged which will be presented and discussed in the following.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
The most commonly used metric for evaluation is the Mean per Joint Position Error (MPJPE).
For $n$ joints, original 3D joint positions $O_i$ and predicted positions $P_i$ it is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}  \norm{O_i - P_i}_2 \ .
\end{equation}

\subsection{Protocol 1}

This protocol is used under different names in slightly different variations in \cite{sun17, drover18, moreno-noguer16, yasin16, kostrikov14, tome17}.
The method commonly referred to as \textbf{Protocol 1} uses subjects S1, S5, S6, S7, S8 and S9 for training and S11 for testing.

Sometimes the train data is thinned out further by the elimination of similar poses \cite{yasin16}.
\citet{drover18} even completely leave out S8 for training.
It allows rigid alignment \cite{drover18, yasin16, kostrikov14, sun17, tome17, chen17} of the predicted poses to the ground truth data.


Most authors do not explicitly state which kind of rigid alignment is applied to the predicted poses.
Those who do mention a Procrustes Analysis \cite{sun17, tome17} or a Least Squares transformation \cite{kostrikov14}.
That basically allows kinds of translation, scaling and rotation can be applied in order to best fit the predicted poses to the ground truth data.

This approach is not very realistic though as in production there is no ground truth data the predicted poses can be fitted to.
A more realistic testing technique is presented in the Section \ref{sec:protocol2}.

In accordance with the code shipped with the Human3.6M dataset, \citet{sun17}, \citet{chen17} and \citet{moreno-noguer16} use only every \nth{64} frame of the available data for testing.

\subsection{Protocol 2}\label{sec:protocol2}

The second protocol found in the literature is \textbf{Protocol 2}.
In this case only S1, S5, S6, S7 and S8 are used for training, while testing is done on S9 and S11.

This method only allows certain noninvasive changes to the predicted poses.
In general a Procrustes Analysis is not allowed.
The degree of the changes applied to the predicted poses strongly depends on the model.
In a system that predicts absolute 3D poses usually no changes have to be made to the predicted poses in order to obtain meaningful results.
With only a monocular 2D projection of a pose, it is not possible to estimate the absolute 3D poses as there are multiple 3D poses which all have the same 2D projection.
Therefore many models \cite{martinez17, zhou18, zhou16, tekin16, pavlakos17} allow aligning two designated root joints (usually the central hip) of the predicted and the ground truth poses.
In cases where it is not possible to correctly estimate the global scale of the poses scaling is also allowed.
\citet{zhou18} do this by scaling the predicted poses such that "the mean limb length is identical to the average value of all training subjects".
One can even go a step further and scale the poses in a way that the mean limb length of the predicted poses is equal to the mean limb length of the subject.
This avoids the artificially introduced bias of different heights of the subjects.

\subsection{Different errors for different sets of joints}
	Using only 15 joints yields a much lower MPJPE than using 32 joints. Reasons: ...	
	From now on all numbers are calculated for 15 joint poses.
