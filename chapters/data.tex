notoriously
Whereas there are a lot of annotated human 2D pose estimation datasets (MPII, COCO Keypoints, PoseTrack, DensePose), there are only very few annotated 3D pose datasets. 
2D poses can be easily captured and annotated.
Only images are necessary for this.
As opposed to this, capturing ground truth data for 3D poses is notoriously harder.
For precise ground truth poses, a motion capture system is required which is not broadly available due to the high cost.
Though, this saves the effort of manual labeling.



In this work, human poses from the Human3.6M dataset \cite{ionescu14} is used for training and evaluation.
It comprises 3.6 million three dimensional human poses captured by four digital cameras and a motion capture system.
Within the dataset 11 subjects (6 male, 5 female; also referred to as S1, S2, \dots, S11) perform 15 different activities, such as walking, taking a photo, eating etc.\footnote{
	The 15 activities are: Giving Directions, Discussing, Eating, Greeting, Phoning, Posing, Purchasing, Sitting, Sitting down (on the ground), SmokinL, Taking a Photo, Waiting, Walking, Walking a Dog and Walking Together.
}
The poses are available in different parametrizations, such as Cartesian coordinates or Kinematic Parametrization.
Throughout this thesis, the 3D poses in the Cartesian coordinate systems of the four digital cameras are used (\texttt{D3\_Positions\_mono} in the dataset).
For those 3D poses, monocular 2D projections onto the cameras' image planes are also available which will also be used for evaluation.

\Todo{Find out what those points are}
The poses in the dataset consist of 32 joints.
In \cite{drover18} only 14 of those joints are used.\footnote{
The 14 joints are: heels, knees, hips, thorax, head, shoulders, elbows and wrists.
}
This work follows the same convention, with the only difference being that the pelvis (center point between hips) is added to those 14 joints.

Later, the system will also be evaluated on poses from the TotalCapture dataset \cite{trumble17}.
This dataset consists of about 1.9 million 3D poses.
One pose comprises 21 joints, among which are the same 15 joints that were selected for the Human3.6M dataset.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
\Todo{Mention Joint Position Error (JPE)? Check with Section \ref{sec:x-shift-error}}
In the literature multiple different methods are used to quantitatively evaluate the estimated poses. 
Essentially most systems estimate the 3D poses in Cartesian coordinates \cite{drover18, chen17, bogo16, grinciunaite16, yasin16, wandt19, tome17, tekin16, tekin17, pavlakos17}.

For this parametrization the most commonly used metric is the \emph{Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE)}.
It is the mean of the \emph{Joint Position Errors (JPE)} across all joints.
For a pose with $n$ joints, ground truth 3D joint positions $G_i$ and predicted positions $P_i$ it is defined as
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}  \norm{G_i - P_i}_2 \ .
\end{equation}
The values for this metric are reported in millimeters.

As \citet{ionescu14} point out, the problem with this metric is that it is highly subject specific.
An estimated pose for a smaller person might be equally bad as for a taller person, but the MPJPE will be much lower for the former.
In order to circumvent this, they propose the \emph{Universal MPJPE (UMPJPE)} which normalizes all poses to have the same dimensions (in their case the same limb lengths) before measuring the Euclidean distance.

While not broadly used, \citet{ionescu14} also suggest the \emph{Mean Per Joint Angle Error (MPJAE)}.
This metric measures the difference of the joint angles between the ground truth and predicted pose.
It is defined as
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} \abs{\alpha_i - \beta_i \mod \pm 180\degree} \,
\end{equation}
where $m$ is the number of joint angles and $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ the angles for the ground truth pose and the estimated pose.
Due to the lacking intuitiveness behind this metric and the straightforward conversion to Cartesian coordinates, although they make use of the Kinematic pose representation, \citet{jahangiri17} and \citet{zhou16_2} also report their results for the MPJPE metric.

\subsection{Evaluation Protocols}

For the MPJPE metric, multiple different evaluation protocols with minor variations have evolved.
Those vary between different datasets, but also within them.
The cause for this is that different systems produce different outputs and thus the evaluation protocols might be stronger or weaker, that is, allow more adjustment than others.

What most systems have in common is that they produce 3D poses only up to a scaling factor.
As for a 2D pose there is an infinite amount of corresponding 3D poses that project to the same pose, unless the absolute size of the 3D pose is known, the pose can hardly be estimated to have that exact size.
And even if that size is known, it is oftentimes easier to estimate poses normalized in size and then scale them to the desired output.
The same holds true for absolute position and rotation (to some extent).
Thus, in order to measure the quality some modifications have to be made in order to measure the quality and allow a fair comparison to other approaches.

In this work the dataset primarily used is Human3.6M.
Hence, in the following the evaluation protocols for this dataset will be reviewed and analyzed.
Essentially, two different protocol can be found in the literature.

\subsubsection{Protocol 1}

This protocol is used under different names in slightly different variations in \cite{sun17, drover18, moreno-noguer16, yasin16, kostrikov14, tome17}.
Concretely, for the Human3.6M dataset, it is commonly referred to as \textbf{Protocol 1} and uses subjects S1, S5, S6, S7, S8 and S9 for training and S11 for testing.

Sometimes the train data is further thinned out by the elimination of poses similar to each other \cite{yasin16}.
Here, the authors consider two poses as similar when the average Euclidean distance between the joints is less than 1.5mm.
\citet{drover18} even completely leave out S8 for training.

For testing, some authors only use every \nth{64} frame of the available test data \cite{sun17, chen17, yasin16, moreno-noguer16, tome17}.
While other authors mention no such thing \cite{drover18, kostrikov14}, it can be assumed it is a general practice, as the code shipped with the Human3.6M dataset also suggests this.

Before calculating the MPJPE, rigid alignment of the predicted poses to the ground truth data is allowed  \cite{drover18, yasin16, kostrikov14, sun17, tome17, chen17}.
Most authors do not explicitly state which kind of rigid alignment is applied to the predicted poses.
Those who do mention a Procrustes Analysis \cite{sun17, tome17} and a Least Squares transformation \cite{kostrikov14}.
Both techniques allow different kinds of translation, scaling and rotation in order to fit the predicted poses to the ground truth data.
Thereby, depending on the exact implementation, the minimal MPJPE possible without changing the joints relative positions to each other might be calculated.

Although this approach ensures the MPJPE is not wrongly too high, e.g. in a situation where the estimated pose is perfect, but slightly rotated compared to the ground truth pose, it also adds a caveat:
Perceptually poorly estimated poses can have a low MPJPE through the heavy transformations applied.
On top of that, in scenarios where the absolute rotation, scale or position of the poses is of interest, Protocol 1 does not offer meaningful results.

In conclusion, Protocol 1 can be characterized as a protocol allowing translation, scaling and rotation in some form being applied to the estimate poses before calculating the MPJPE.

\subsubsection{Protocol 2}\label{sec:protocol2}

The second protocol found in the literature is \textbf{Protocol 2}.
In this case only S1, S5, S6, S7 and S8 are used for training, while test results are reported for S9 and S11.

Whereas \citet{sun17} only use every \nth{64} frame and \citet{moreno-noguer16} and \citet{bogo16} only use camera 3 for testing, most authors do not mention which poses exactly are used for testing.

This protocol only allows certain noninvasive changes to the predicted poses.
In general rigid alignment like a Procrustes Analysis is not allowed.
The degree of the changes applied to the predicted poses strongly depends on the model.
In a system that predicts absolute 3D poses usually no changes have to be made to the predicted poses in order to obtain meaningful results.
With only a monocular 2D projection of a pose, it is not possible to estimate the absolute 3D poses as there are multiple 3D poses which all have the same 2D projection.
Therefore many models \cite{martinez17, zhou18, zhou16, tekin16, pavlakos17} allow aligning two designated root joints (usually the central hip) of the predicted and the ground truth poses.
In cases where it is not possible to correctly estimate the global scale of the poses scaling is also allowed.
\citet{zhou18} do this by scaling the predicted poses such that "the mean limb length is identical to the average value of all training subjects".
This is still suboptimal because if the subjects have different mean limb lengths (which is the case) the error for a perfect prediction would not be 0.
A better way of scaling would be the following:

First, calculate the average limb length $L_s$ of all poses for each subject $s$.
Then, scale each predicted and ground truth pose in a way that the mean limb length is equal to $L_s$.

Because adjusting the ground truth data is not a good practice in general, in this thesis only the predicted poses are scaled to match $L_s$.

The scaling of the estimated 3D poses can be regarded as follows. Let $\alpha$ be the average limb lengths of the ground truth pose and $\beta$ be the one of the estimated poses.
Then the error is calculated in the following way:
\begin{align}
	\Delta d &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}  \norm{\alpha \frac{O_i}{\beta} - \alpha \frac{P_i}{\alpha}}_2 \\
	&=  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \abs{\alpha} \norm{\frac{O_i}{\beta} -\frac{P_i}{\alpha}}_2 \\
	&=  \abs{\alpha} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \norm{\frac{O_i}{\beta} -\frac{P_i}{\alpha}}_2 \ .
	\label{eq:protocol2-mpjpe-scaling}
\end{align}

This can be interpreted such that the MPJPE is first calculated for the poses with normalized average limb length and then scaled such that the original scale of the ground truth poses is represented. 

IMPORTANT: An MPJPE of approximately 5mm can be measured when comparing the scaled ground truth poses with the original ones (the standard deviation of the scaling factors is at $0.01$).!!!!

\Todo[inline]{Mention TotalCapture dataset briefly. Also compare Protocol 1 and 2: "Rotation is the key difference while rotation and translation of the Procrustes transformation might also be better"}

Protocol 1: Better: Absolute minimal MPJPE, no wrongly too high numbers
