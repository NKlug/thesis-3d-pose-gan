\section{Training with different data}

\subsection{Different errors for different sets of joints}
Using only 15 joints yields a much lower MPJPE than using 32 joints. Reasons: ...	
From now on all numbers are calculated for 15 joint poses.

\subsection{Training with 1:1 mix of augmented and real data}
Results for original data get better



\subsection{Training with augmented cameras similar to the real cameras}
Results for original data
